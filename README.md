# Eat and Enjoy Restaurant

## Overview

Eat and Enjoy Restaurant is a Node.js web application demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a RESTful API approach. It utilizes Express.js as the web framework and EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as the template engine for rendering dynamic HTML content.

## Purpose

The project showcases how to build a simple restaurant management system where users can manage menu items. Key features include:

- **Create:** Add new menu items with details such as name, description, price, and image URL.
- **Read:** View a list of menu items with their details.
- **Update:** Modify existing menu items.
- **Delete:** Remove menu items from the list.

The application illustrates:

- Implementation of RESTful routing principles in Express.js for handling HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
- Use of EJS templates for rendering dynamic HTML pages with server-side data.
- Basic error handling and validation practices.

## Getting Started
